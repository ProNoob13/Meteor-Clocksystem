# Meteor Clocksystem
A simple application to track the time you (and your team) have spend on different projects, built as a learning project in [Meteor](http://meteor.com/).

It's intended to be installed on a private intranet as it currently lacks user accounts, and hasn't been tested anywhere but in Chrome.
